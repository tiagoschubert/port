      <h3>The Window Object</h3>
        <p>
            It is supported by all browsers and represents the browser's window. Global Javascript functions, variables
            and onjects automatically become members of the window object. There are also window object methods. One that
            is commonly used is the alert() method. It displays an alert box with a message and an ok button.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Storage API vs. Cookies</h3>
            
                <p> 
                    . Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.

                </p>
                <p> 
                    . Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the
                    same).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    . Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    . Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes
                    cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.
                </p>
